              <p>Harvey Gorsuch, Owner/Founder of HUNT, began developing his style over sixty-four years ago as a ten year old living  in Ferndale, Washington. After spending a summer picking strawberries, he spent his entire wages ($23.00) on three sets of underwear, socks, and an orange and white vertical striped shirt at Kean’s Department Store.</p>
              <p>This early appreciation for an intentional investment associated with the development of a personal clothing style eventually led to Harvey’s frequent trips during the 70’s and 80’s from his home in Bellingham to a men’s thrift store in Seattle on Madison Avenue. His enthusiasm for menswear resale set him on the path to opening up his own shop.</p>
              <p>In December of 2016, Harvey opened HUNT Gentlemen’s Resale on Edmunds Street in the vibrant neighborhood of Columbia City. HUNT has since become a destination shop in the evolving style scene of Seattle. Located in the Shirley Marvin Hotel Annex, HUNT is a “tiny house” boutique with a cozy arrangement of high end goods.</p>
